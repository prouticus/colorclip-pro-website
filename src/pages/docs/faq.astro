  <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

  <h2>General</h2>

  </ul>

  <h3>Is my color data private?</h3>
  <p>
    Yes! Your palette data is stored locally on your device by default. If you enable
    cloud sync, your data is encrypted in transit and stored securely. We never share
    your color data with third parties.
  </p>

  <h2>Features</h2>

  <h3>How many swatches can I have in a palette?</h3>
  <p>
    Each palette can hold up to 256 swatches. You can create unlimited palettes.
  </p>

  <h3>What color formats are supported?</h3>
  <p>
    ColorClip Pro supports:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>HEX</strong> - 8-digit (#RRGGBBAA) and 6-digit (#RRGGBB)</li>
    <li><strong>RGB</strong> - 0-255 range with alpha</li>
    <li><strong>HSV</strong> - Hue (0-360), Saturation/Value (0-100)</li>
    <li><strong>Normalized RGB</strong> - 0.0-1.0 range (for graphics programming)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Does the eyedropper work with all applications?</h3>
  <p>
    Yes! The eyedropper captures colors from anywhere on your screen, including:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Design tools (Figma, Sketch, Adobe XD, Photoshop, etc.)</li>
    <li>Web browsers</li>
    <li>Other applications</li>
    <li>Your desktop wallpaper</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Can I use ColorClip Pro offline?</h3>
  <p>
    Absolutely! ColorClip Pro works completely offline. Cloud sync is optional - you
    can use the app without ever signing in.
  </p>

  <h2>Cloud Sync</h2>

  <h3>How does cloud sync work?</h3>
  <p>
    When enabled, ColorClip Pro syncs your palettes to our secure cloud servers in
    real-time. Changes you make on one device appear instantly on all your other devices.
  </p>

  <h3>What if I make changes on two devices at the same time?</h3>
  <p>
    ColorClip Pro uses smart conflict resolution. If the same swatch is changed on two
    devices simultaneously, the most recent change wins. Color history tracks all
    changes, so you can always recover previous versions.
  </p>

  <h3>Can I sync palettes with my team?</h3>
  <p>
    Currently, palettes are private to your account. Team collaboration features are
    planned for a future release. In the meantime, you can use the export/import
    feature to share palettes.
  </p>

  <h3>Which authentication providers are supported?</h3>
  <p>
    You can sign in with:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Google</li>
    <li>GitHub</li>
    <li>Discord</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>

  <h3>The eyedropper isn't working on macOS</h3>
  <p>
    ColorClip Pro needs screen recording permission to capture colors:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Open <strong>System Settings → Privacy & Security → Screen Recording</strong></li>
    <li>Enable ColorClip Pro in the list</li>
    <li>Restart ColorClip Pro</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>My palettes aren't syncing</h3>
  <p>
    Check these common issues:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Make sure you're signed in with the same account on all devices</li>
    <li>Check your internet connection</li>
    <li>Look for the cloud sync icon - if it shows an error, click it for details</li>
    <li>Try signing out and back in</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>ColorClip Pro won't launch on macOS</h3>
  <p>
    See the <a href="/docs/installation#first-launch-macos-security">macOS security section</a>
    in the installation guide. You may need to right-click and select "Open" the first time.
  </p>
